## transition effects for DHGR slideshows## Each Mega-Attract Module that is a DHGR slideshow (see attract.conf)# will use a single transition effect for the length of the module.# Transition effects are loaded in the order listed in this file. Each line# of this file is a filename (not including comments, like this one). The# name of the next transition effect is stored in the global prefs, so this# file should not contain duplicates.## Transition effects are binary files loaded at $6000 and called with DHGR# page 1 showing and the next DHGR graphic already loaded at $4000/main and# $4000/aux. A transition effect has full use of main and auxiliary memory,# including zero pages and text pages if needed. LC RAM banks 1 and 2 are# reserved for the launcher.## Important: LC RAM bank 1 will be read/write on entry and must be read/write# on exit. If you need ROM routines, you are responsible for switching to ROM# then switching back to RAM bank 1 (read/write) before returning.#DHGR.FIZZLEDHGR.RIPPLEDHGR.RADIALDHGR.STARDHGR.RADIAL3DHGR.IRISDHGR.RADIAL2DHGR.RADIAL4DHGR.RADIAL5[eof]
