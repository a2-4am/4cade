## transition effects for HGR slideshows## Each Mega-Attract Module that is an HGR slideshow (see attract.conf)# will use a single transition effect for the length of the module.# Transition effects are loaded in the order listed in this file. Each line# of this file is a filename (not including comments, like this one). The# name of the next transition effect is stored in the global prefs, so this# file should not contain duplicates.## Transition effects are binary files loaded at $6000 and called with# hi-res page 1 showing and the next HGR graphic already loaded at $4000.# A transition effect has full use of main memory, including zero page and# text page if needed. LC RAM banks 1 and 2 are reserved for the launcher.## Important: LC RAM bank 1 will be read/write on entry and must be read/write# on exit. If you need ROM routines, you are responsible for switching to ROM# then switching back to RAM bank 1 (read/write) before returning.#RIPPLEDIAGONALSTAGGERWHITE.UDSTARRADIALFIZZLECRYSTALSUNRISESUNSETCORNER.CIRCLERIPPLE2RADIAL2RADIAL3RADIAL4RADIAL5FOURSPIRALIRISSPLIT.UD.INTROCHECKERBOARDHALF.FIZZLEBAR.DISSOLVESTAGGERWHITE.LRDIAMONDONESQUARETWOPASS.LRHALF.MOSAICSTAGGER.LRFOURSQUARESTAGGER.UDINTERLOCK.LRBLOCK.MOSAICINTERLOCK.UDBLOCK.FIZZLESPIRAL[eof]
