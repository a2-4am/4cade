GetGameDisplayName
; in:    A/Y points to game filename
; out:   C clear if game exists in gGamesListStore, and
;          A/Y points to game display name (but see hack notes below)
;          X = game index, or #$FF if the game doesn't really exist but
;          we want to return a successful result anyway (really, read the
;          hack notes, they're important)
;        C set if game does not exist (this can happen because slideshows
;          list games that require a joystick, but the games list parser
;          filters out joystick-only games if the machine doesn't have a
;          joystick)
