; VIDHD-SPECIFIC HACK HERE!
; On the II/II+/IIe, all $C03x addresses are aliases for $C030, i.e. the speaker.
; Any single access of the speaker register requires a second access within a short
; time to balance the level if we want to avoid an audible click, which we do here.
; Since we can't read from SHADOW before writing to it (it returns random values on
; 8-bit machines, which VidHD interprets as invalid graphic modes and crashes hard),
; we instead balance the speaker access with a second write to the same speaker-
; aliased softswitch. Do not remove.
