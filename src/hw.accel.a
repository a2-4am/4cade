;
; Functions to enable and disable acceleration on various
; Apple II models, cards, and environments
;
; Forked from NORMFAST Release 6 (see changelog below)
;
; No functional changes to the acceleration routines, but for
; Total Replay, we split the machine identification code from
; the (de)acceleration code, because we can do the ID part once
; at program startup (when ROM is easily available), then
; (de)accelerate repeatedly from the language card (when ROM
; is switched out).
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Original changelog and documentation:
;
;;; NORMFAST Disable/enable Apple II compatible accelerator
; (no copyright info given)
;
; Release 7 2019-11-27 FASTChip control just like ZipChip.
; Prevents unexpected acceleration by user.
;
; Release 6 2017-10-05 Fix Mac IIe card check
;
; Release 5 2017-09-27 Add Macintosh IIe Card. Addon
; accelerators are now set blindly, so will access
; annunciators/IIc locations and may trigger the
; paddle timer.
; No plans for the Saturn Systems Accelerator which would
; require a slot search.
;
; Release 4 2017-09-06 Add Laser 128EX, TransWarp I, UW
;
; Release 3 2017-08-29 Change FASTChip partially back to
; release 1, which seems to work the way release 2 was
; intended?!
;
; Release 2 2017-08-27 change enable entry point, add Zip
; Chip, change setting FASTChip speed to disable/enable
;
; Release 1 2017-08-25 IIGS, //c+ and FASTChip
;
; WARNING: The memory location to set the accelerator
; speed may overlap existing locations such as:
;   annuciators or Apple //c specific hardware
;   paddle trigger
;
; Known to work: IIGS, //c+
; Theoretically: FASTChip, Laser 128EX, Mac IIe Card,
;   TransWarp I, trademarked German product, Zip Chip
;
; BRUN NORMFAST or CALL 768 to disable the accelerator.
; CALL 771 to enable the accelerator.
; Enabling an older accelerator may set maximum speed.
; Accelerators such as the FASTChip or Zip Chip can run
; slower than 1Mhz when enabled.
;
; NORMFAST is position independent and can be loaded most
; anywhere in the first 48K of memory.
; The ROMs must be enabled to identify the model of the
; computer.
;
; This was originally for the //c+ which is normally
; difficult to set to 1Mhz speed.
; The other expected use is to set the speed in a program.
;
; Written for Andrew Jacobs' Java based dev65 assembler at
; http://sourceforge.net/projects/dev65 but has portability
; in mind.
